## How to Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in values (see Environment Variables section below)

# Run development server
npm run dev

# App runs at http://localhost:3000
```

### Local Subdomain Testing
To test subdomain routing locally, add entries to `/etc/hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1 kings-cut.localhost
127.0.0.1 test-shop.localhost
```
Then visit `http://kings-cut.localhost:3000`

## Environment Variables

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=           # From Supabase project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=      # From Supabase project settings
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=          # From Supabase project settings (server only)

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tenancy
Each barbershop is identified by their subdomain slug:
- `kings-cut.pangkasin.com` → slug: `kings-cut`
- Next.js middleware extracts subdomain from hostname
- Shop loaded from `barbershops` table by `slug`
- All DB queries scoped to resolved `barbershop_id`

### Auth Flow
- Single login page at `/admin/login` for both owners and barbers
- After Supabase Auth verification, role checked from `users` table
- `owner` → redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
- `barber` → redirect to `/barber/schedule`
- Unauthenticated access to `/admin/*` or `/barber/*` → redirect to `/`

### i18n
- Default locale: `id` (Bahasa Indonesia)
- Supported: `id`, `en`
- Translation files: `/messages/id.json`, `/messages/en.json`
- Never hardcode UI strings — always use translation keys

---

## Database Schema

> See PRD.md for full schema detail during initial setup.
> Update this section as schema evolves.

### Tables
- `barbershops` — one row per client shop
- `locations` — shop locations (v1: single per shop)
- `barbers` — individual barbers per shop
- `services` — services offered (no price — price on barber_services)
- `barber_services` — join table: which barber does which service + their price
- `bookings` — customer appointment records
- `schedules` — working hours per barber per day of week
- `blocked_dates` — barber days off / holidays
- `users` — admin users linked to Supabase Auth

### Key Design Decisions
- `services` has no price — price lives on `barber_services` (supports both service-based and barber-based pricing)
- `barber_services.is_available = false` → barber card grayed out in booking flow
- `locations` table exists from day one even though v1 UI is single-location only
- `barbershops.country` and `.currency` fields exist for future SEA expansion

- Full gitflow: `main` → `dev` → `feature/*`
- Never push directly to main
- Feature branches: `feature/booking-flow`, `fix/slot-availability`

## Key Decisions Log

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Price on `barber_services`, not `services` | Supports both service-based and barber-based pricing models |
| `locations` table from day one | Avoids schema migration when adding multi-location in v2 |
| Single login page for owner + barber | Simpler UX, role-based redirect after auth |
| No customer accounts | Reduces friction — guest booking with name + phone only |
| No WhatsApp in v1 | Scope control for 1-month timeline |
| Xendit over Midtrans (v2) | Supports 6 SEA countries for future international expansion |
| Space Grotesk font | Matches Stitch-generated design system (Midnight Obsidian theme) |
